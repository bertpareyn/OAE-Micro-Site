        <h1 id="designgoals_header">Sakai OAE Design Goals</h1>
        <div class="designgoals_column">
            <h2 class="designgoals_header2">Sakai OAE is a scholarly space for research, teaching and learning.</h2>
            <p><strong>It’s designed by educators for educators to:</strong></p>
            <p>Provide a user-friendly experience informed by the needs of learners, teachers and researchers.</p>
            <p>Offer powerful capabilities for content authoring, sharing and re-use.</p>
            <p>Enable group collaboration and social networking within an academic context and around learning, teaching and research interests.</p>
            <p>Focus on learners, groups and their activities, and is not site-centric.</p>
            <p>Create and deliver cohesive learning experiences and portfolio processes, and to promote student engagement.</p>
            <p>Be highly configurable and scalable at both small and enterprise levels.</p>
            <p>Enable easy software development and system integration </p>
            <p>Use an Agile Sakai code base built atop other reliable open source projects.</p>
            <p>Be a design-led project that includes ongoing usability and accessibility research.</p>
            <p>Interoperate with other systems and educational resources as an open-source project.</p>

            <h2 class="designgoals_header2">Concrete steps and concepts</h2>
            <p><strong>Building on these design goals are several key areas of emphasis.</strong></p>

            <h2 class="designgoals_header2">Flexible, controllable workspaces</h2>
            <p><strong>People should be able to:</strong></p>
            <p>Integrate tools and resources into pages by inserting tool widgets, including widgets by third parties, leading to almost infinite flexibility.</p>
            <p>Constrain page composition to a single author working within a predetermined template, or open it up to multiple contributors working wiki-style.</p>
            <p>Easily store, reuse and share successful patterns as ‘templates’.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="designgoals_column">
            <h2 class="designgoals_header2">People, networking, and groups</h2>
            <p><strong>People should be able to:</strong></p>
            <p>Tell others in their institution, and the wider world, about themselves, find others with related interests, and readily form workgroups for various activities.</p>
            <p>Build up contact lists offering preferential communications and sharing.</p>

            <h2 class="designgoals_header2">Resource discovery and use</h2>
            <p><strong>People should be able to:</strong></p>
            <p>Use Sakai OAE acts as a resource discovery platform which commonly describes both uploaded files and materials from many other sources.</p>
            <p>Flexibly manage these resources, from small, private collections to large, shared collections or libraries.</p>

            <h2 class="designgoals_header2">Openness and permeability</h2>
            <p><strong>People should be able to:</strong></p>
            <p>Access all public content, including support for open teaching activities, anonymously (although individual applications may be configured otherwise).</p>
            <p>Access external resources and functionality within the context of Sakai activities.</p>
            <p>Access Sakai OAE resources and functionality through external systems where appropriate (configured according to institutional policy).</p>
            <p>Comment on, track and assess all entities – everything on the system is ‘content’.</p>
            <p>Connect all activities together in workflows – Sakai OAE offers deliberate support for mash-ups.</p>
            
        </div>

        <div class="designgoals_column">
            <h2 class="designgoals_header2">Communication and sharing</h2>
            <p><strong>People should be able to:</strong></p>
            <p>Share content one to one, or one to many, without requiring a common membership in a single workspace.</p>
            <p>Have personalized or filtered experiences that cut across spaces and activities.</p>
            <p>Collaborate seamlessly, irrespective of who with or the tools they use.</p>

            <h2 class="designgoals_header2">Teaching and learning capabilities</h2>
            <p><strong>Sakai OAE should support the core capabilities identified by Sakai's Teaching and Learning community:</strong></p>

            <p><i><strong>(See the Sakai Learning Capabilities v 1.0  for more info)</strong></i></p>

            <h2 class="designgoals_header2">Increased scalability, smaller code-base and footprint</h2>
            <p><strong>Sakai OAE is a developer-friendly application that actively encourages third-party development.</strong></p>
            <p>High quality widget SDK supports non-professional component developers among students and instructors.</p>
            <p>Sakai looks to realize the concept of restful data apis to support novel mash-ups of information, ease of development for new UI functionality, and familiar technologies for design oriented developers.</p>
            <p>To provide a robust, scalable and maintainable core, Sakai OAE makes optimal use of industry-tested and supported back-end platforms that implement open standards, such as Sling (Jackrabbit JCR and Felix OSGi) and ActiveMQ (JMS).</p>
