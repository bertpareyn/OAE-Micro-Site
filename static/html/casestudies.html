                <p class="subheader"><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
                <p>NYU wants to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Support (even highly specialized) academic networking</li>
                    <li>Promote eportfolios</li>
                    <li>Enable innovative pedagogy</li>
                    <li>Build a continuum between learning, research and teaching</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="subheader"><strong>The Solution</strong></p>
                <p>ATLAS Network, NYU’s pilot OAE platform, hosts academic groups, eportfolios and courses. Its widget architecture and widget software development kit make it affordable to create small, targeted pieces of functionality. Helping support the most niche projects.</p>
                <p>More than 6000 people use ATLAS across seven NYU sites worldwide. Each semester, 40 courses deploy the system. Participants clude:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Liberal Studies program (within Faculty of Arts and Science)</li>
                    <li>College of Nursing</li>
                    <li>Gallatin Schol of Individualized Study</li>
                    <li>NYU Open Ed Initiative</li>
                    <li>Steinhardt School of Education and Culture</li>
                    <li>Humanities Initiative.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="subheader"><strong>The Results</strong></p>

                <h2>Academic networking</h2>
                <p><span class="subheader"><strong>Connecting better.</strong></span> Undergraduate and graduate courses use the system to help faculty and students connect across semesters, courses, and cohorts. Elements from other NYU ITS services, and from Google Apps for Education and Kaltura video, are easily integrated.</p>
                <p><span class="subheader"><strong>Enabling more efficient working.</strong></span> People can customize system tags with school and program taxonomies; then pull these tags from users’ profiles into groups’ participant lists and resource lists.</p>
                <p><span class="subheader"><strong>Growing professional relationships.</strong></span> Learners and tutors on some courses can use self-representational ‘walls’ to find out more about each other’s professional activities and interests. Ideal when student and faculty mentor don’t get to meet but still need a working relationship.</p>
                <p><span class="subheader"><strong>Inspiring independent projects.</strong></span> Everyone can create groups and share content. So many people are using the platform to organize themselves, their materials and their courses for independent projects.</p>

                <h2>Eportfolios</h2>
                <p><span class="subheader"><strong>Optimizing resources.</strong></span> Undergraduates on BA Global Liberal Studies (GLS) courses at NYU sites worldwide can add coursework and independent resarch to their own archive eportfolios. These serve as central points for organizing material for academic projects and sharing it with tutors. Through their eportfolios, GLS learners also receive three reflection prompts across the academic year.</p>
                <p><span class="subheader"><strong>Growing networking skills.</strong></span> For its graduates, NYU’s Silver School of Social Work hosts a professional development eportfolio. Structured activities around eportfolios and sharing help learners to sharpen their networking and other professional skills, and to get feedback from faculty and alumni mentors.</p>

                <h2>Innovative pedagogy</h2>
                <p><span class="subheader"><strong>Maximizing multimedia.</strong></span> For faculty, ATLAS meets course needs which standard learning management systems or NYU services such as Google Apps can’t. For example, learners can use the system to create work incorporating multimedia – ideal where learners are challenged to extend their critical thinking and writing skills into mediums like visual art, audio and video.</p>
                <p><span class="subheader"><strong>Increasing re-use.</strong></span> Sets of pages can be authored independently from course sites. Enabling tutors to re-use materials over multiple semesters, and learners to save important chunks of course materials, such as reading lists or collections of readings, to their personal libraries for future use.</p>
                <p><span class="subheader"><strong>Enhancing information flows.</strong></span> People can create ‘master groups’ – from which information flows to sub groups, but not vice versa. Especially popular for tutors of multi-section courses who want to stimulate group coherence after a semeseter has ended.</p>
                <p><span class="subheader"><strong>Boosting copyright awareness.</strong></span> Faculty members who rely on materials in library-licensed databases can make links to these. Enabling them to model awareness of copyright laws and best practice for observing them.</p>

                <h2>Learning/research/teaching continuum</h2>
                <p><span class="subheader"><strong>Smoothing the transition.</strong></span> NYU’s Humanities Initiative uses ATLAS to showcase faculty members’ work and graduate’s research projects. Using the system’s content authoring and collection tools, people assemble work and report to the group on their progress. When people return to tutoring, these materials are available for sharing internally within courses, and externally for colleagues at other institutions.</p>

                <h1>American Academy of Religion</h1>
                <p class="subheader"><strong>The American Academy of Religion (AAR) is a 10,000-member interdisciplinary association of faculty and graduate students who engage in the critical, academic study of religion. Our primary purpose is serving as a global forum for intellectual exchange. Like scores of other learned societies, our members are based at hundreds of colleges and universities.</strong></p>

                <p>Since 2009, we’ve seen huge potential in OAE for academic association members like ours and we remain intensely interested in and supportive of OAE’s development. For us, the potential of OAE lies in its capacity to improve academic research and to allow for its dissemination to scholarly and non-scholarly audiences.</p>

                <h2>Academic networking</h2>
                <p>Bringing multiple methodological and demographic perspectives to bear on a problem tends to lead to more creative solutions. Methodologies and cultures are like boxes; and, to the extent that researchers reside in the same one, truly creative, out-of-the-box thinking is unlikely to occur.</p>
                <p>Current academic association forums offer some intellectual cross-fertilization, but that exchange is constrained by the number of association memberships a scholar can afford, which for many is but one.</p>

                <h2>Enhanced academic engagement</h2>
                <p>Scholars tend to share their ideas primarily with each other. Yet scholars ultimately depend on a broader appreciation of their work. Governments, philanthropists, and parents subsidize faculty research through legislative funding, foundation grants and tuition payments.</p>
                <p>That support needs to continue, particularly in the humanities and social sciences, and our OAE vision would enhance the necessary dissemination of knowledge as it is generated.</p>

                <h2>Broadening the conversation</h2>
                <p>Bringing multiple methodological and demographic perspectives to bear on a problem tends to lead to more creative solutions. Methodologies and cultures are like boxes; and, to the extent that researchers reside in the same one, truly creative, out-of-the-box thinking is unlikely to occur. </p>

                <h2>Connecting with the professionals</h2>
                <p>Journalists, publishers, policy analysts, and museum curators are among those related professionals who play a key intermediary role in interpreting and communicating scholars’ ideas to broader audiences.</p>
                <p>By configuring OAE so that scholar-users can opt to make their profiles, their contact information, and their research discoverable by these related professionals can serve to broaden audiences and, in the case of the AAR, foster excellence in the study of religion.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Advance change-management processes towards full OAE implementation</li>

                    <li>Identify key users who can be useful partners in further system rollouts</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="subheader"><strong>The Solution</strong></p>
                <p>Focused on fewer than 300 participants, CSU’s third pilot of OAE ran from July to September 2012. During this time, the system – badged as Interact2 – transitioned from Sakai OAE v1.3 to 1.4.</p>

                <p><span class="subheader"><strong>The Results</strong></p>
                <p><span class="subheader"><strong>Easing the switch.</strong></span> To support the pilot and prepare for full implementation later in 2012, CSU is introducing a comprehensive program of change management and professional development.</p>
                <p><span class="subheader"><strong>Exploring the potential.</strong></span> CSU’s Educational Designers used the pilot to develop Interact2 exemplars to fit various pedagogies, beginning with theoretical foundations. Designers and faculty re-use these resources when collaborating on new approaches to teaching and learning.</p>
                <p><span class="subheader"><strong>Offering help.</strong></span> CSU has developed comprehensive help and support documentation which system users and the wider public can access online.</p>
                <p><span class="subheader"><strong>Aiding admin.</strong></span> Course directors and admin staff use Interact2 to develop course ‘sites’ for CSU’s 40,000 learners and staff. These are used for administration purposes, rather than for teaching and learning. Each unique site is based on an easy-to-adapt template developed by Course Directors and the Interact2 Project Team earlier in the year.</p>
